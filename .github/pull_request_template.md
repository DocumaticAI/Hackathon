Feedback like "the tool is awesome" wouldn't be accepted, or "the tool is bad." Please state how you feel about the tool and why

Example of good feedback:

 "Myself and my team used the tool to document our code after we made an electron application. The speed it took to document was in less than 15 seconds and it was quick to understand. The content produced captured the parts of the code I wanted to capture."
