<h1 align="center">Notepad Plus ( Python ) </h1>

If you've ever used notepads, you know that they're pretty useful interims of taking notes.
But you also would know that notepads are pretty frustrating to organize.

So... I made something along the lines of a "notepad" in python.

## Installation

To install the application, you'll need to install the [application](application/main) directory. mainly the "main" folder.

and to launch the application all you need to do is launch the **"main.exe"** file.

## Features

Everything is pretty self-explanatory when it comes to this app.

* You can import an existing file into the app. (Only .txt supported)
* You can create files within the app. (creates ".txt" files)
* You can delete multiple files at once. making it simple to organize your files.
* there is a small text editor that you can use to edit the files.
* there is a password system inplace to protect your files.
* You can rename files.

## Pull requests

As the Documatic hackathon's deadline is 20th January,
I will look over pull requests after that deadline is met.
